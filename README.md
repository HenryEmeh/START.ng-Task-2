# CSS A CUTTING EDGE FEATURE WITH RESPECT TO HTML

As we learned previously;

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript(Js).

During my work on task3 I found how more appealing CSS made my work look. As I used the colors, different styling and element tags to my advantage.

I also improved on my usage of different styling. Be it Inline or outside.

Prior to CSS, nearly all of the all the font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.

This is how we left off with the file using only HTML.

This is how the CV looks after CSS implementation.
